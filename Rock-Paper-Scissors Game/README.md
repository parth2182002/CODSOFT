## Rock Paper Scissors - GUI Game

It's a very simple game, in this game we have to choose one option from Rock, Paper or scissor and then the computer will choose some option randomly and then the winner is declared according to some specific conditions.

I created this game in Python Language. I used the Tkinter module to give it a GUI look.

## Pre-Requisites:
1. You need to have python installed on your system.
2. You have to install a pillow module.

You only need above two things to run this code in your system successfully.

I used Tkinter, random, and Pillow module in this project. Tkinter and Random modules are pre-installed modules, but you need to install Pillow to import or insert .jpg images of the game in the code.


Simply execute the below command in the terminal, 
```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Winning Conditions

```python
